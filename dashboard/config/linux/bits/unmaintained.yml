 # Linux kernel still has a big number of XFS v4 bugs, but, as v4 is getting deprecated,
 # the upstream community has no interest in fixing those code problems.
 # See e.g. these links:

 - XFS_SUPPORT_V4

 # Floppy driver is known to be buggy, maintainers see no sense in further reports at the moment.
