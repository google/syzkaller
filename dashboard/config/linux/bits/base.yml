# Common config fragments required by syzbot for all kernels

# CONFIG_DEBUG_MEMORY was once added to mm tree and cause disabling of KASAN,
# which in turn caused storm of assorted crashes after silent memory corruptions.
# The config was reverted, but we keep it here for the case it is reintroduced to kernel again.
# CONFIG_TWIST_KERNEL_BEHAVIOR can be used to prevent fuzzers from trying stupid things.
# See https://github.com/google/syzkaller/issues/1622 for details.
# DEBUG_AID_FOR_SYZBOT can be used to enable any additional temporal debugging features in linux-next tree.
# It is kept in verbatim because it has for some reason disappeared from next-20220222.
