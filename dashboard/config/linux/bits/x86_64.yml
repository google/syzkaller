 # Deterministic hang/stall detection.
 # Without careful tuning the same hang/stall can be detected in multiple, radically-different ways.
 # For example, an infinite loop can be detected as CPU stall, RCU stall, hung task or workqueue stall.
 # This may lead to lots of duplicate bugs. In order to prevent this we strictly order hang/stall detection
 # timeouts based on their causality (CPU stall can cause hung task, but not vise versa). See #516 for details.
 #
 # 1. RCU stalls has the highest priority.
 #    RCU_CPU_STALL_TIMEOUT=100 results in stalls detected after 100-101 secs.
 #
 # 2. Then softlockup detector.
 #    kernel.watchdog_thresh = 55 detects stalls after 110-132 secs.
 #
 # 3. Then hung tasks and workqueue stalls.
 #    Unfortunately we can't separate them because that would require setting "no output" timeout to 10+ minutes.
 #    watchdog_thresh=140 and DEFAULT_HUNG_TASK_TIMEOUT=140 both result in detection after 140-280 secs.
 #
 # 4. Finally, "no output" crashes.
 #    sys/targets.Timeouts.NoOutput is set to 300 secs.
 #
 # Don't change these values without considering all other values as well.
 # Note: executor also sets hung_task_check_interval_secs=20 sysctl.
 # Note: gVisor watchdog timeout is 3 mins + 1/4 of that for checking period = 3m45s.
 # Note: other arches that use qemu emulation scale all these timeouts by 3 (sys/targets.Timeouts.Scale).
