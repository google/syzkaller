 # 5.10 has lots of io_uring bugs that are not easy (if not impossible) to backport, e.g.:
 #
 # KASAN: use-after-free Read in io_uring_cancel_task_requests
 # KASAN: use-after-free Read in io_kill_linked_timeout
 # KASAN: invalid-free in io_dismantle_req
 # KASAN: use-after-free Read in __fdget_raw
 # KASAN: stack-out-of-bounds Read in iov_iter_revert
 # general protection fault in io_prep_async_work
 #
 # An attempt to back-port usually fails because there is too many changes/dependencies
 # that went in between v5.10 and v5.12, where most of the io_uring issues are fixed.
 # After comparing io_uring related git history between 5.10 and 5.12, the diff is
 # around 180 commits, from which half are fixes and the rest additions/new features.
 # None of these have been marked with 'Fixes' or cc'ed to stable, so it is very
 # unlikely that these are going to be fixed in 5.10 stable kernel.
