# File hierarchies to lay on top of default images

`pkg/build/openbsd.go` replaces the files in the image generated by
`create-openbsd-vmm-worker.sh` with the contents of `ci-openbsd-multicore/`.
A minor bit of missing connection between `userspaceDir` and this
location is managed outside this repository by the local filesystem
state on the `ci-openbsd` machine.
