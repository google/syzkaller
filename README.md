# syzkaller - linux syscall fuzzer

`syzkaller` is an unsupervised, coverage-guided Linux syscall fuzzer.
It is meant to be used with [KASAN](https://kernel.org/doc/html/latest/dev-tools/kasan.html) (`CONFIG_KASAN=y`),
[KTSAN](https://github.com/google/ktsan) (`CONFIG_KTSAN=y`),
or [KUBSAN](https://kernel.org/doc/html/latest/dev-tools/ubsan.html).

## Usage

Various components are needed to build and run syzkaller.

 - C compiler with coverage support
 - Linux kernel with coverage additions
 - QEMU and disk image
 - The syzkaller components

Setting each of these up is discussed in the following sections.

### C Compiler

Syzkaller is a coverage-guided fuzzer and so needs the kernel to be built with coverage support.
Therefore, a recent version of GCC is needed. Coverage support is submitted to gcc in
revision `231296`, released in gcc6.

### Linux Kernel

As well as adding coverage support to the C compiler, the Linux kernel itself needs to be modified
to:
 - add support in the build system for the coverage options (under `CONFIG_KCOV`)
 - add extra instrumentation on system call entry/exit (for a `CONFIG_KCOV` build)
 - add code to track and report per-task coverage information.

KCOV is upstreamed in linux 4.6. For older kernels you need to backport commit [5c9a8750a6409c63a0f01d51a9024861022f6593](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/5c9a8750a6409c63a0f01d51a9024861022f6593). The kernel should be configured with `CONFIG_KCOV`.

See [Kernel configs](https://github.com/google/syzkaller/wiki/Kernel-configs) for details on configuring kernel.

### QEMU Setup

Syzkaller runs its fuzzer processes inside QEMU virtual machines, so a working QEMU system is needed
&ndash; see [QEMU docs](http://wiki.qemu.org/Manual) for details.

In particular:

 - The fuzzing processes communicate with the outside world, so the VM image needs to include
   networking support.
 - The program files for the fuzzer processes are transmitted into the VM using SSH, so the VM image
   needs a running SSH server.
 - The VM's SSH configuration should be set up to allow root access for the identity that is
   included in the `syz-manager`'s configuration.  In other words, you should be able to do `ssh -i
   $SSHID -p $PORT root@localhost` without being prompted for a password (where `SSHID` is the SSH
   identification file and `PORT` is the port that are specified in the `syz-manager` configuration
   file).
 - The kernel exports coverage information via a debugfs entry, so the VM image needs to mount
   the debugfs filesystem at `/sys/kernel/debug`.

[create-image.sh](tools/create-image.sh) script can be used to create a suitable Linux image.

Syzkaller also supports kvmtool VMs, GCE VMs and running on real android devices. TODO: Describe how to support other types of VMs.

### Syzkaller

The syzkaller tools are written in [Go](https://golang.org), so a Go compiler (>= 1.7) is needed
to build them.

Go distribution can be downloaded from https://golang.org/dl/.
Unpack Go into a directory, say, `$HOME/go`.
Then, set `GOROOT=$HOME/go` env var.
Then, add Go binaries to `PATH`, `PATH=$HOME/go/bin:$PATH`.
Then, set `GOPATH` env var to some empty dir, say `GOPATH=$HOME/gopath`.
Then, run `go get -d github.com/google/syzkaller/...` to checkout syzkaller sources with all dependencies.
Then, `cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/google/syzkaller` and
build with `make`, which generates compiled binaries in the `bin/` folder.

## Configuration

The operation of the syzkaller `syz-manager` process is governed by a configuration file, passed at
invocation time with the `-config` option.  This configuration can be based on the
[syz-manager/example.cfg](syz-manager/example.cfg); the file is in JSON format with the
following keys in its top-level object:

 - `http`: URL that will display information about the running `syz-manager` process.
 - `workdir`: Location of a working directory for the `syz-manager` process. Outputs here include:
     - `<workdir>/instance-x`: per VM instance temporary files
     - `<workdir>/crashes/*`: crash output files (see [Crash Reports](#crash-reports))
     - `<workdir>/corpus/*`: corpus with interesting programs
 - `syzkaller`: Location of the `syzkaller` checkout.
 - `vmlinux`: Location of the `vmlinux` file that corresponds to the kernel being tested.
 - `type`: Type of virtual machine to use, e.g. `qemu` or `kvm`.
 - `count`: Number of VMs to run in parallel.
 - `procs`: Number of parallel test processes in each VM (4 or 8 would be a reasonable number).
 - `leak`: Detect memory leaks with kmemleak (very slow).
 - `kernel`: Location of the `bzImage` file for the kernel to be tested; this is passed as the
   `-kernel` option to `qemu-system-x86_64`.
 - `cmdline`: Additional command line options for the booting kernel, for example `root=/dev/sda1`.
 - `image`: Location of the disk image file for the QEMU instance; a copy of this file is passed as the
   `-hda` option to `qemu-system-x86_64`.
 - `sshkey`: Location (on the host machine) of an SSH identity to use for communicating with
   the virtual machine.
 - `cpu`: Number of CPUs to simulate in the VM (*not currently used*).
 - `mem`: Amount of memory (in MiB) for the VM; this is passed as the `-m` option to `qemu-system-x86_64`.
 - `sandbox` : Sandboxing mode, one of "none", "setuid", "namespace".
     "none": don't do anything special (has false positives, e.g. due to killing init)
     "setuid": impersonate into user nobody (65534), default
     "namespace": use namespaces to drop privileges,
     (requires a kernel built with `CONFIG_NAMESPACES`, `CONFIG_UTS_NS`,
     `CONFIG_USER_NS`, `CONFIG_PID_NS` and `CONFIG_NET_NS`).
 - `enable_syscalls`: List of syscalls to test (optional).
 - `disable_syscalls`: List of system calls that should be treated as disabled (optional).
 - `suppressions`: List of regexps for known bugs.

See also [config/config.go](config/config.go) for all config parameters.


## Running syzkaller

Start the `syz-manager` process as:
```
./bin/syz-manager -config my.cfg
```

The `-config` command line option gives the location of the configuration file
[described above](#configuration).

The `syz-manager` process will wind up qemu virtual machines and start fuzzing in them.
It also reports some statistics on the HTTP address.


## Process Structure

The process structure for the syzkaller system is shown in the following diagram; red labels
indicate corresponding configuration options.

![Process structure for syzkaller](structure.png?raw=true)

The `syz-manager` process starts, monitors and restarts several VM instances (support for
physical machines is not implemented yet), and starts a `syz-fuzzer` process inside of the VMs.
It is responsible for persistent corpus and crash storage. As opposed to `syz-fuzzer` processes,
it runs on a host with stable kernel which does not experience white-noise fuzzer load.

The `syz-fuzzer` process runs inside of presumably unstable VMs (or physical machines under test).
The `syz-fuzzer` guides fuzzing process itself (input generation, mutation, minimization, etc)
and sends inputs that trigger new coverage back to the `syz-manager` process via RPC.
It also starts transient `syz-executor` processes.

Each `syz-executor` process executes a single input (a sequence of syscalls).
It accepts the program to execute from the `syz-fuzzer` process and sends results back.
It is designed to be as simple as possible (to not interfere with fuzzing process),
written in C++, compiled as static binary and uses shared memory for communication.

## Crash Reports

When `syzkaller` finds a crasher, it saves information about it into `workdir/crashes` directory. The directory contains one subdirectory per unique crash type. Each subdirectory contains a `description` file with a unique string identifying the crash (intended for bug identification and deduplication); and up to 100 `logN` and `reportN` files, one pair per test machine crash:
```
 - crashes/
   - 6e512290efa36515a7a27e53623304d20d1c3e
     - description
     - log0
     - report0
     - log1
     - report1
     ...
   - 77c578906abe311d06227b9dc3bffa4c52676f
     - description
     - log0
     - report0
     ...
```

Descriptions are extracted using a set of [regular expressions](report/report.go#L33). This set may need to be extended if you are using a different kernel architecture, or are just seeing a previously unseen kernel error messages.

`logN` files contain raw `syzkaller` logs and include kernel console output as well as programs executed before the crash. These logs can be fed to `syz-repro` tool for [crash location and minimization](https://github.com/google/syzkaller/wiki/Crash-reproducer-programs), or to `syz-execprog` tool for [manual localization](https://github.com/google/syzkaller/wiki/How-to-execute-syzkaller-programs). `reportN` files contain post-processed and symbolized kernel crash reports (e.g. a KASAN report). Normally you need just 1 pair of these files (i.e. `log0` and `report0`), because they all presumably describe the same kernel bug. However, `syzkaller` saves up to 100 of them for the case when the crash is poorly reproducible, or if you just want to look at a set of crash reports to infer some similarities or differences.

There are 3 special types of crashes:
 - `no output from test machine`: the test machine produces no output whatsoever
 - `lost connection to test machine`: the ssh connection to the machine was unexpectedly closed
 - `test machine is not executing programs`: the machine looks alive, but no test programs were executed for long period of time
Most likely you won't see `reportN` files for these crashes (e.g. if there is no output from the test machine, there is nothing to put into report). Sometimes these crashes indicate a bug in `syzkaller` itself (especially if you see a Go panic message in the logs). However, frequently they mean a kernel lockup or something similarly bad (here are just a few examples of bugs found this way: [1](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/syzkaller/zfuHHRXL7Zg/Tc5rK8bdCAAJ), [2](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/syzkaller/kY_ml6TCm9A/wDd5fYFXBQAJ), [3](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/syzkaller/OM7CXieBCoY/etzvFPX3AQAJ)).

## Syscall description

`syzkaller` uses declarative description of syscalls to generate, mutate, minimize,
serialize and deserialize programs (sequences of syscalls). See details about the
format and extending the descriptions in [sys/README.md](sys/README.md).

## Troubleshooting

Here are some things to check if there are problems running syzkaller.

 - Check that QEMU can successfully boot the virtual machine.  For example,
   if `IMAGE` is set to the VM's disk image (as per the `image` config value)
   and `KERNEL` is set to the test kernel (as per the `kernel` config value)
   then something like the following command should start the VM successfully:

       ```qemu-system-x86_64 -hda $IMAGE -m 256 -net nic -net user,host=10.0.2.10,hostfwd=tcp::23505-:22 -enable-kvm -kernel $KERNEL -append root=/dev/sda```

 - Check that inbound SSH to the running virtual machine works.  For example, with
   a VM running and with `SSHKEY` set to the SSH identity (as per the `sshkey` config value) the
   following command should connect:

       ```ssh -i $SSHKEY -p 23505 root@localhost```

 - Check that the `CONFIG_KCOV` option is available inside the VM:
    - `ls /sys/kernel/debug       # Check debugfs mounted`
    - `ls /sys/kernel/debug/kcov  # Check kcov enabled`
    - Build the test program from `Documentation/kcov.txt` and run it inside the VM.

 - Check that debug information (from the `CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO` option) is available
    - Pass the hex output from the kcov test program to `addr2line -a -i -f -e $VMLINUX` (where
      `VMLINUX` is the vmlinux file, as per the `vmlinux` config value), to confirm
      that symbols for the kernel are available.

 - Use the `-v N` command line option to increase the amount of logging output, from both
   the `syz-manager` top-level program and the `syz-fuzzer` instances (which go to the
   output files in the `crashes` subdirectory of the working directory). Higher values of
   N give more output.

 - If logging indicates problems with the executor program (e.g. `executor failure`),
   try manually running a short sequence of system calls:
     - Build additional tools with `make all-tools`
     - Copy `syz-executor` and `syz-execprog` into a running VM.
     - In the VM run `./syz-execprog -executor ./syz-executor -debug sampleprog` where
       sampleprog is a simple system call script (e.g. just containing `getpid()`).
     - For example, if this reports that `clone` has failed, this probably indicates
       that the test kernel does not include support for all of the required namespaces.
       In this case, running the `syz-execprog` test with the `-nobody=0` option fixes the problem,
       so the main configuration needs to be updated to set `dropprivs` to `false`.
