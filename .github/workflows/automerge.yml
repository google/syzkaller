# When a "autocommit" label is applied to a PR, this action will wait for CI to pass
# and then merge the PR using rebase method (preserving individual commits).
# Similarly, "autosquash" label will result in merging using squash method
# (commit the whole PR as a single commit).
# The action respects github branch protection rules, in particular this is where
# "wait for CI" part is configured:
