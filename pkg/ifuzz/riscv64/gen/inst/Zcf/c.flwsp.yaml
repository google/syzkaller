long_name: Load word into floating-point register from stack
description: |
  Loads a single-precision floating-point value from memory into floating-point register fd.
  It computes its effective address by adding the zero-extended offset, scaled by 4,
  to the stack pointer, x2.
  It expands to `flw` `fd, offset(x2)`.
