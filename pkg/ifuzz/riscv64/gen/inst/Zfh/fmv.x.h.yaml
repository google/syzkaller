long_name: Move half-precision value from floating-point to integer register
definedBy:
  extension:
    name: Zfhmin
assembly: xd, fs1
description: |
  Moves the half-precision value in floating-point register fs1 represented in IEEE 754-2008
  encoding to the lower 16 bits of integer register xd.

  The bits are not modified in the transfer, and in particular, the payloads of non-canonical
  NaNs are preserved.

  The highest XLEN-16 bits of the destination register are filled with copies of the
  floating-point number's sign bit.
encoding:
  match: 111001000000-----000-----1010011
  variables:
    - name: fs1
      location: 19-15
    - name: xd
      location: 11-7

  s: always
  u: always

  check_f_ok($encoding);

  X[xd] = sext(f[fs1][15:0], 16);
