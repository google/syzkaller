kind: instruction
name: sctrclr
long_name: Supervisor Control Transfer Record (CTR) clear
description: |
  When `mstateen0.CTR`=1, the SCTRCLR instruction performs the following operations:

  * Zeroes all CTR Entry Registers, for all DEPTH values
  * Reset to Zero the optional CTR cycle counter where implemented
  ** `ctrdata.CC` and `ctrdata.CCV` bit fields.

  Any read of `ctrsource`, `ctrtarget`, or `ctrdata` that follows SCTRCLR, such that it precedes the next
  qualified control transfer, will return the value 0.

  Further, the first recorded transfer following SCTRCLR will have `ctrdata.CCV`=0.

  SCTRCLR execution causes an `IllegalInstruction` exception if:

  * `Smctr` is not implemented
  * The instruction is executed in S/VS/VU-mode and `Ssctr` is not implemented, or `mstateen0.CTR`=0
  * The instruction is executed in U-mode

  SCTRCLR execution  causes a `VirtualInstruciton` exception if `mstateen0.CTR`=1 and:

  * The instruction is executed in VS-mode and `hstateen0.CTR`=0
  * The instruction is executed in VU-mode
