long_name: Floating-Point Move Single-Precision Word to Integer Register
description: |
  The `fmv.x.w` instruction moves the single-precision value in floating-point register `fs1`` represented in `IEEE 754-2008`
  encoding to the lower 32 bits of integer register `xd`. The bits are not modified in the transfer, and in particular, the
  payloads of non-canonical NaNs are preserved. For RV64, the higher 32 bits of the destination register are filled with copies
  of the floating-point number's sign bit.
