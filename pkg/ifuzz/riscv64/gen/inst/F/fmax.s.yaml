kind: instruction
name: fmax.s
long_name: Floating-Point Maximum-Number Single-Precision
description: |
  The `fmax.s` instruction writes larger of `fs1` and `fs2` to `fd`. For the purposes of this instruction,
  the value `-0.0` is considered to be less than the value `+0.0`. If both inputs are NaNs, the result is
  the canonical NaN. If only one operand is a NaN, the result is the non-NaN operand. Signaling NaN inputs
  set the invalid operation exception flag, even when the result is not NaN.

  [NOTE]
  ====
  Note that in version 2.2 of the F extension, the `fmin.s` and `fmax.s` instructions were amended to implement
  the proposed _IEEE 754-201x_ `minimumNumber` and `maximumNumber` operations, rather than the _IEEE 754-2008_
  _minNum_ and _maxNum_ operations. These operations differ in their handling of signaling NaNs.
