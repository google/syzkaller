long_name: Signed 32-bit division
description: |
  Divide the lower 32-bits of register xs1 by the lower 32-bits of register xs2,
  and store the sign-extended result in xd.

  The remainder is discarded.

  Division by zero will put -1 into xd.

  Division resulting in signed overflow (when most negative number is divided by -1)
  will put the most negative number into xd;
