description: |
  The `fld` instruction loads a double-precision floating-point value from memory into floating-point
  register `fd`. It is guaranteed to execute atomically if the effective address is naturally aligned
  and XLEN≥64. It doesn't modify the bits being transferred; in particular, the payloads of non-canonical
  NaNs are preserved.
