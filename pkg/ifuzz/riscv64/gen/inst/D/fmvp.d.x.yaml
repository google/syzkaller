long_name: Floating-Point Move Pair from Integer Registers to Double-Precision Register
description: |
  The `fmvp.d.x` instruction moves a double-precision number from a pair of integer registers into a floating-point
  register. Integer registers `xs1` and `xs2` supply bits 31:0 and 63:32, respectively; the result is written to
  floating-point register `fd`.
