kind: instruction
name: fround.d
long_name: Floating-Point Round Double-Precision
description: |
  The `fround.d` instruction rounds the double-precision floating-point number in floating-point register
  `fs1` to an integer, according to the rounding mode specified in the instruction's `rm` field. It then writes
  that integer, represented as a double-precision floating-point number, to floating-point register `fd`. Zero
  and infinite inputs are copied to `fd` unmodified. Signaling NaN inputs cause the invalid operation
  exception flag to be set; no other exception flags are set. `fround.d` is encoded like `fcvt.d.s`, but with
  `xs2` set to 4.
