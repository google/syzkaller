description: |
  The `fsgnj.d` instruction produces a result that takes all bits except the sign bit from `fs1`.
  The result's sign bit is taken from `fs2`'s sign bit, and the result is written to the destination
  register `fd`. Sign-injection instructions do not set floating-point exception flags, nor do they
  canonicalize NaNs.
