  The single-precision to double-precision conversion instruction, `fcvt.d.s` is encoded in the OP-FP
  major opcode space and both the source and destination are floating-point registers. The `xs2` field
  encodes the datatype of the source, and the `fmt` field encodes the datatype of the destination.
  `fcvt.d.s` will never round.
