long_name: Floating-Point Round-to-Integer Inexact Double-Precision
description: |
  The `froundnx.d` instruction is defined in the same way as `fround.d`, but it also sets the inexact exception flag if the input
  differs from the rounded result and is not NaN. `froundnx.d` is encoded like `fcvt.d.s`, but with `xs2` set to 5.
