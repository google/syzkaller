description: |
  The `fcvt.s.d` instruction converts a double-precision floating-point number to a single-precision floating-point
  number. This is encoded in the OP-FP major opcode space and both the source and destination are floating-point
  registers. The `xs2` field encodes the datatype of the source, and the `fmt` field encodes the datatype of the
  destination. `fcvt.s.d` rounds according to the `rm` field.
