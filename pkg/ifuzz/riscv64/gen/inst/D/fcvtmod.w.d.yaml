kind: instruction
name: fcvtmod.w.d
long_name: Floating-Point Convert Double-Precision to Word with Modulo
description: |
  The `fcvtmod.w.d` instruction always rounds towards zero. Bits 31:0 are taken from the rounded, unbounded
  two's complement result, then sign-extended to XLEN bits and written to integer register `xd`. ±∞ and
  NaN are converted to zero.

  Floating-point exception flags are raised the same as they would be for `fcvt.w.d` with the same input
  operand.

  This instruction is only provided if the D extension is implemented. It is encoded like `fcvt.w.d`, but
  with the `xs2` field set to 8 and the `rm` field set to 1 (RTZ). Other `rm` values are reserved.
