description: |
  The `fsd` instruction stores a double-precision value from the floating-point registers to memory. It is guaranteed to execute
  atomically if the effective address is naturally aligned and XLEN≥64. It doesn't modify the bits being transferred; in particular,
  the payloads of non-canonical NaNs are preserved.
