long_name: Atomic Read and Clear Bits in CSR
description: |
  The CSRRC (Atomic Read and Clear Bits in CSR) instruction reads the value of the CSR, zero-extends
  the value to XLEN bits, and writes it to integer register `xd`. The initial value in integer register `xs1` is
  treated as a bit mask that specifies bit positions to be cleared in the CSR. Any bit that is high in `xs1` will
  cause the corresponding bit to be cleared in the CSR, if that CSR bit is writable.

  For CSRRC, if `xs1=x0`, then the instruction will not write to the CSR at all, and so shall
  not cause any of the side effects that might otherwise occur on a CSR write, nor raise illegal-
  instruction exceptions on accesses to read-only CSRs. CSRRC always reads the addressed CSR and
  cause any read side effects regardless of `xs1` and `xd` fields.
  Note that if `xs1` specifies a register other than `x0`, and that register holds a zero value,
  the instruction will not action any attendant per-field side effects, but will action any
  side effects caused by writing to the entire CSR.
