long_name: Atomic Read and Set Bits in CSR
description: |
  Atomically read and set bits in a CSR.

  Reads the value of the CSR, zero-extends the value to `XLEN` bits,
  and writes it to integer register `xd`. The initial value in integer
  register `xs1` is treated as a bit mask that specifies bit positions
  to be set in the CSR. Any bit that is high in `xs1` will cause the
  corresponding bit to be set in the CSR, if that CSR bit is writable.
  Other bits in the CSR are not explicitly written.
