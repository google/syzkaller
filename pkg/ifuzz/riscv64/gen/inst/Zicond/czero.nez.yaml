kind: instruction
name: czero.nez
long_name: Conditional zero, if condition is nonzero
description: |
  If xs2 contains a nonzero value, this instruction writes the value zero to xd. Otherwise, this
  instruction copies the contents of xs1 to xd.
  This instruction carries a syntactic dependency from both xs1 and xs2 to xd. Furthermore, if the Zkt
  extension is implemented, this instruction's timing is independent of the data values in xs1 and xs2.
