name: wrs.nto
long_name: Wait-on-Reservation-Set-with-No-Timeout
description: |
  To mitigate the wasteful looping in such usages, a `wrs.nto` (WRS-with-no-timeout) instruction is provided.
  Instead of polling for a store to a specific memory location, software registers a reservation set that
  includes all the bytes of the memory location using the LR instruction. Then a subsequent `wrs.nto`
  instruction would cause the hart to temporarily stall execution in a low-power state until a store
  occurs to the reservation set or an interrupt is observed.

  This instruction is not supported in a constrained LR/SC loop.
  While stalled, an implementation is permitted to occasionally terminate the stall and complete
  execution for any reason.

  `wrs.nto` follows the rules of the WFI instruction for resuming execution
  on a pending interrupt.

  When the TW (Timeout Wait) bit in `mstatus` is set and `wrs.nto` is executed
  in any privilege mode otherthan M mode, and it does not complete within an implementation-specific
  bounded time limit, the `wrs.nto` instruction will cause an illegal instruction exception.

  When executing in VS or VU mode, if the VTW bit is set in `hstatus`, the TW bit in `mstatus` is clear,
  and the `wrs.nto` does not complete within an implementation-specific bounded time limit,
  the `wrs.nto` instruction will cause a virtual instruction exception.

  [Note]
  Since `wrs.nto` can complete execution for reasons other than stores to the reservation set,
  software will likely need a means of looping until the required stores have occurred.

  [Note]
  `wrs.nto`, unlike WFI, is not specified to cause an illegal instruction exception if executed in U-mode
  when the governing TW bit is 0. WFI is typically not expected to be used in U-mode and on many systems
  may promptly cause an illegal instruction exception if used at U-mode.
  Unlike WFI, `wrs.nto` is expected to be used by software in U-mode when waiting on memory but without
  a deadline for that wait.
