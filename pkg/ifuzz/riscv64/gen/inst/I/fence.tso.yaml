name: fence.tso
long_name: Memory ordering fence, total store ordering
description: |
  Orders memory operations.

  `fence.tso` orders all load operations
  in its predecessor set before all memory operations in its successor set, and all store operations
  in its predecessor set before all store operations in its successor set. This leaves non-AMO store
  operations in the 'fence.tso's predecessor set unordered with non-AMO loads in its successor set.

  The `xs1` and `xd` fields are unused and ignored.

  In modes other than M-mode, `fence.tso` is further affected by `menvcfg.FIOM`,
  `senvcfg.FIOM`<% if ext?(:H) %>, and/or `henvcfg.FIOM`<% end %>.
