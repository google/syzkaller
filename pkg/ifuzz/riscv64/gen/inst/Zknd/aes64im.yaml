description: |
  The instruction applies the inverse MixColumns transformation to two columns of the state array,
  packed into a single 64-bit register. It is used to create the inverse cipher KeySchedule, according to
  the equivalent inverse cipher construction in (NIST, 2001) (Page 23, Section 5.3.5).
