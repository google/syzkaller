kind: instruction
name: c.lui
long_name: Load Upper Immediate
description: |
  C.LUI loads the non-zero 6-bit immediate field into bits 17-12 of the destination register, clears the bottom 12 bits, and sign-extends bit 17 into all higher bits of the destination.
  C.LUI expands into `lui xd, imm`.
  C.LUI is only valid when xd&ne;x0 and xd&ne;x2, and when the immediate is not equal to zero.
  The code points with imm=0 are reserved; the remaining code points with xd=x0 are HINTs; and the remaining code points with xd=x2 correspond to the C.ADDI16SP instruction
