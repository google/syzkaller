long_name: Add a zero-extended non-zero immediate, scaled by 4, to the stack pointer
description: |
  Adds a zero-extended non-zero immediate, scaled by 4, to the stack pointer, x2, and writes the result to rd'.
  This instruction is used to generate pointers to stack-allocated variables.
  It expands to `addi rd', x2, nzuimm[9:2]`.
  C.ADDI4SPN is only valid when nzuimm &ne; 0; the code points with nzuimm=0 are reserved.
