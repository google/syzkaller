long_name: Load word from stack pointer
description: |
  Loads a 32-bit value from memory into register xd.
  It computes an effective address by adding the zero-extended offset, scaled by 4,
  to the stack pointer, x2.
  It expands to `lw` `xd, offset(x2)`.
  C.LWSP is only valid when xd &ne; x0. The code points with xd=x0 are reserved.
