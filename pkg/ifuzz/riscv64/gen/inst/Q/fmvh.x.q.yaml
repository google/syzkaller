kind: instruction
name: fmvh.x.q
long_name: Floating-Point Move High Half to Integer from Quad-Precision
description: |
  The `fmvh.x.q` instruction moves bits `127:64` of floating-point register `fs1` into integer register `xd`.
  It is encoded in the OP-FP major opcode with _funct3_=0, _rs2_=1, and _funct7_=1110011.

  `fmvh.x.q` is used in conjunction with the existing `fmv.x.d` instruction to move a quad-precision floating-point
  number to a pair of x-registers.
