description: |
  The `fsgnj.q` instruction produces a result that takes all bits except the sign bit from `fs1`.
  The result's sign bit is taken from `fs2`'s sign bit, and the result is written to the destination register `fd`.
  `fsgnj.q` does not set floating-point exception flags, nor do they canonicalize _NaN_s.
