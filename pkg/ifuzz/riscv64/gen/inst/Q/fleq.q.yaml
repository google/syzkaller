kind: instruction
name: fleq.q
long_name: Floating-Point Less Than or Equal Quiet Quad-Precision
description: |
  The `fleq.q` performs the specified comparison between floating-point registers `fs1` and `fs2`,
  and writes 1 to integer register `xd` if the condition holds, and 0 otherwise.

  `fleq.q` is defined like `fle.q`, except that quiet _NaN_ inputs do not cause the invalid
  operation exception flag to be set.
  This instruction is encoded like its `flt` counterpart, but with instruction bit 14 set to 1.
