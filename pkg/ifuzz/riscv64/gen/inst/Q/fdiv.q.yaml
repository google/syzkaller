kind: instruction
name: fdiv.q
long_name: Floating-Point Divide Quad-Precision
description: |
  The `fdiv.q` performs the quad-precision floating-point division of `fs1` by `fs2` and writes
  the result to floating-point register `fd`.`
  The rounding mode is specified by the value in the floating-point Control and Status register (FCSR)
  or by the value in the `rm` field of the instruction.

  The operation is performed according to the IEEE 754-2008 standard for quad-precision floating-point arithmetic.

  The instruction sets the floating-point exception flags according to the result of the operation.
