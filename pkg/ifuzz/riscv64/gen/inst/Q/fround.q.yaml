kind: instruction
name: fround.q
long_name: Floating-Point Round Quad-Precision
description: |
  The `fround.q` instruction rounds the quad-precision floating-point number in floating-point register
  `fs1` to an integer, according to the rounding mode specified in the instruction's `rm` field. It then writes
  that integer, represented as a quad-precision floating-point number, to floating-point register `fd`. Zero
  and infinite inputs are copied to `fd` unmodified. Signaling _NaN_ inputs cause the invalid operation
  exception flag to be set; no other exception flags are set. `fround.q` is encoded like `fcvt.q.s`, but with
  `rs2`=4.
