kind: instruction
name: fmaxm.q
long_name: Floating-Point Maximum-Number NaN Quad-Precision
description: |
  The `fmaxm.q` instruction, defined like `fmax.q`, writes the larger/maximum of `fs1` and `fs2` to `fd`.
  The value `-0.0` is considered to be less than the value `+0.0`.
  If both inputs are _NaN_s, the result is the canonical _NaN_.
  If either input is _NaN_, the result is the canonical _NaN_.
  Signaling _NaN_ inputs set the invalid operation exception flag, even when the result is not _NaN_.
  This instruction is encoded like its `fminm.q` counterpart, but with instruction bit 14 set to 1.
