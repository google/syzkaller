kind: instruction
name: fclass.q
long_name: Floating-Point Classify Quad-Precision
description: |
  The `fclass.q` instruction examines the value in floating-point register `rs1` and writes to integer
  register `rd` a 10-bit mask that indicates the class of the floating-point number.

  The format of the mask is described in table given below. The corresponding bit in `rd`
  will be set if the property is true and clear otherwise. All other bits in `rd` are cleared.

  Note that exactly one bit in `rd` will be set. `fclass.q` does not set the floating-point
  exception flags.

  .Format of result of `fclass` instruction.
