long_name: Floating-Point Less Than Quad-Precision
description: |
  The `flt.q` performs the specified comparison between floating-point registers `fs1` and `fs2`,
  and writes 1 to integer register `xd` if the conditon hold, and 0 otherwise.


  `flt.q` performs what the IEEE 754-2008 standard refers to as signaling comparisons: that is,
  they set the invalid operation exception flag if either input is _NaN_.
  The result is 0 if either operand is _NaN_.
