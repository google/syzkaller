  The `fsq` is the new variant of LOAD-FP, encoded with a new value for the `funct3`.

  `fsq` is only guaranteed to execute atomically if the effective address is naturally aligned XLEN=128.

  `fsq` does not modify the bits being transferred; in particular, the payloads of non-canonical
  _NaNs_ are preserved.
