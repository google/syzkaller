long_name: Floating-Point Move Pair from Integer Registers to Quad-Precision Register
description: |
  The `fmvp.q.x` instruction moves a double-precision number from a pair of integer registers into
  a floating-point register.
  Integer registers `xs1` and `xs2` supply bits 63:0 and 127:64, respectively; the result is written to
  floating-point register `fd`.
  `fmvp.q.x` is encoded in the OP-FP major opcode with _funct3_=0 and _funct7_=1011011.
