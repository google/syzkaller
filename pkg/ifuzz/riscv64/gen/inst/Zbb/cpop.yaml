long_name: Count set bits
description: |
  Counts the number of 1's (i.e., set bits) in the source register.

  .Software Hint
  [NOTE]
  ----
  This operations is known as population count, popcount, sideways sum,
  bit summation, or Hamming weight.

  The GCC builtin function `__builtin_popcount (unsigned int x)` is
  implemented by cpop on RV32 and by cpopw on RV64. The GCC builtin
  function `__builtin_popcountl (unsigned long x)` for LP64 is
  implemented by cpop on RV64.
