description: |
  The FENCE.I instruction is used to synchronize the instruction and data
  streams. RISC-V does not guarantee that stores to instruction memory
  will be made visible to instruction fetches on a RISC-V hart until that
  hart executes a FENCE.I instruction. A FENCE.I instruction ensures that
  a subsequent instruction fetch on a RISC-V hart will see any previous
  data stores already visible to the same RISC-V hart. FENCE.I does _not_
  ensure that other RISC-V harts' instruction fetches will observe the
  local hart's stores in a multiprocessor system. To make a store to
  instruction memory visible to all RISC-V harts, the writing hart also
  has to execute a data FENCE before requesting that all remote RISC-V
  harts execute a FENCE.I.

  The unused fields in the FENCE.I instruction, _imm[11:0]_, _xs1_, and
  _xd_, are reserved for finer-grain fences in future extensions. For
  forward compatibility, base implementations shall ignore these fields,
  and standard software shall zero these fields.
  (((FENCE.I, finer-grained)))
  (((FENCE.I, forward compatibility)))

  [NOTE]
  ====
  Because FENCE.I only orders stores with a hart's own instruction
  fetches, application code should only rely upon FENCE.I if the
  application thread will not be migrated to a different hart. The EEI can
  provide mechanisms for efficient multiprocessor instruction-stream
  synchronization.
