# syz-testbed

`syz-testbed` is the tool that simplifies the process of evaluating the effect
the performance of different syzkaller versions (or configurations) against each
other. The tool automates checking out syzkaller repos, building them, running
`syz-manager`s and collecting/summarizing their results.

## Configuring syz-testbed

`syz-testbed` takes a JSON config file as its input. An example of such a file:

```json
{
  "workdir": "/tmp/syz-testbed-workdir/",
  "corpus": "/tmp/corpus.db",
  "checkouts": [
    {
      "name": "first",
      "repo": "https://github.com/google/syzkaller.git",
      "count": 2
    },
    {
      "name": "second",
      "repo": "https://github.com/google/syzkaller.git",
      "branch": "some-dev-branch",
      "count": 2
    }
  ],
  "manager_config": {
	  "target": "linux/amd64",
	  "http": "0.0.0.0:50000",
	  "kernel_obj": "/tmp/linux-stable",
	  "image": "/tmp/kernel-image/stretch.img",
	  "sshkey": "/tmp/kernel-image/stretch.id_rsa",
	  "procs": 8,
	  "type": "qemu",
	  "vm": {
          "count": 2,
          "kernel": "/tmp/linux-stable/arch/x86/boot/bzImage",
          "cpu": 2,
          "mem": 2048
	  }
  }
}
```

When run with such a configuration file, `syz-testbench` will do the following:
1. Check out the `master` branch of `https://github.com/google/syzkaller.git`
   into `/tmp/workdir/checkouts/first/`.
   2. Generate two independent config files for that syzkaller. They will have
   separate `workdir`'s (`/tmp/syz-testbed-workdir/checkouts/first/workdir_1/`
   and ``/tmp/syz-testbed-workdir/checkouts/first/workdir_2`), separate names
   (`first-1` and `first-2`) and separate ports (50000 and
   50001). `/tmp/corpus.db` is copied into each of the work directories and will
   be used by `syz-manager`s as the initial corpus.
3. Build syzkaller at `/tmp/syz-testbed-workdir/first/`.
4. Check out the `some-dev-branch` of
   `https://github.com/google/syzkaller.git` into
   `/tmp/syz-testbed-workdir/second/`.
5. Do the same as was done in the steps 2 and 3, but for the `second` folder.
6. The resulting directory structure looks as follows

```
/tmp/syz-testbed-workdir/
└── checkouts
    ├── first
<...>
    │   ├── syz_1.cnf
    │   ├── syz_2.cnf
<...>
    │   ├── workdir_1
    │   └── workdir_2
    └── second
<...>
        ├── syz_1.cnf
        ├── syz_2.cnf
<...>
        ├── workdir_1
        └── workdir_2
```

7. Finally `syz-testbed` runs all the `syz-manager` instances it has
   prepared. The config file above results in 4 instances: 2 belonging the
   `first` checkout and 2 belonging to the `second` one.

Right after the 7th step `syz-testbed` begins to collect and aggregate the data
from the running syzkaller instances.

```bash
$ tree -L 2 /tmp/syz-testbed-workdir/
/tmp/syz-testbed-workdir/
├── benches
│   ├── avg_first.txt
│   └── avg_second.txt
├── bugs.csv
├── checkouts
│   ├── first
│   └── second
├── checkout_stats.csv
└── instance_stats.csv
```

1. `bugs.csv` contains all the bugs found by the running instances. If a single
   checkout has several instances (i.e. `count` > 1), `syz-testbed` takes a
   union of bugs found by them. The purpose is ultimately to collect all bugs
   that could be found by that version of syzkaller.
2. Statistics that is generated by individual `syz-manager`s is saved into
   `instance_stats.csv`. The same data is also averaged among instances that
   belong to the same checkouts and saved into the `checkout_stats.csv` file.
3. Bench files (see `tools/syz-benchcmp`) of all `syz-manager`s belonging to a
   single checkout are averaged and saved into the corresponding files in the
   `benches` folder.

The statics is updated once every 90 seconds.

## Running syz-testbed

First, checkout the most recent version of syzkaller itself:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/google/syzkaller.git
```

Then, build `syz-testbed`:

```
$ cd syzkaller/tools/syz-testbed/
$ go build
```

Write and save the configuration file (e.g. into the `config.json` file). Then,
`syz-testbed` can be run using the following command:

```
$ ./syz-testbed -config config.json
```

Stopping the `syz-testbed` process results in stopping all the syzkaller instances.
