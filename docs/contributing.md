## Contributing

If you want to contribute to the project, you need to [sign Google CLA](https://cla.developers.google.com/) and add yourself to [AUTHORS](AUTHORS)/[CONTRIBUTORS](CONTRIBUTORS) files in the first pull request. Extending/improving [system call descriptions](sys/sys.txt) is always a good idea. If you want to work on something non-trivial, please briefly describe it on [syzkaller@googlegroups.com](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/syzkaller) mailing list first so that there is agreement on high level approach and no duplication of work between contributors.
