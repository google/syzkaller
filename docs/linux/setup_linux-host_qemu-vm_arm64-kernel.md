# Setup: Linux host, QEMU vm, arm64 kernel

This document will detail the steps involved in setting up a Syzkaller instance fuzzing any ARM64 linux kernel of your choice.

## Create a disk image

We will use buildroot to create the disk image.
You can obtain buildroot from [here](https://buildroot.uclibc.org/download.html).
Extract the tarball and perform a `make menuconfig` inside it.
Choose the following options.

    Target options
	    Target Architecture - Aarch64 (little endian)
    Toolchain type
	    External toolchain - Linaro AArch64
    System Configuration
    [*] Enable root login with password
            ( ) Root password = set your password using this option
    [*] Run a getty (login prompt) after boot  --->
	    TTY port - ttyAMA0
    Target packages
	    [*]   Show packages that are also provided by busybox
	    Networking applications
	        [*] dhcpcd
	        [*] iproute2
	        [*] openssh
    Filesystem images
	    [*] ext2/3/4 root filesystem
	        ext2/3/4 variant - ext3
	        exact size in blocks - 6000000
	    [*] tar the root filesystem

Run `make`. After the build, confirm that `output/images/rootfs.ext3` exists.

If you're expreriencing a very slow sshd start up time with arm64 qemu running on x86, the reason is probably low entropy and it be "fixed" with installing `haveged`. It can be found in the buildroot `menuconfig`:

```
    Target packages
	    Miscellaneous
	        [*] haveged
```

## Get the ARM64 toolchain from Linaro

You will require an ARM64 kernel with gcc plugin support.
If not, obtain the ARM64 toolchain from Linaro.
Get `gcc-linaro-6.1.1-2016.08-x86_64_aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.xz` from [here](https://releases.linaro.org/components/toolchain/binaries/latest/aarch64-linux-gnu/).
Extract and add its `bin/` to your `PATH`.
If you have another ARM64 toolchain on your machine, ensure that this newly downloaded toolchain takes precedence.

## Compile the kernel

Get the source code of the Linux kernel version you want to fuzz, and do the following.

    $ ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- make defconfig
    $ vim .config

Change the following options :
```
    CONFIG_KCOV=y
    CONFIG_KASAN=y
    CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO=y
    CONFIG_CMDLINE="console=ttyAMA0"
    CONFIG_KCOV_INSTRUMENT_ALL=y
    CONFIG_DEBUG_FS=y
    CONFIG_NET_9P=y
    CONFIG_NET_9P_VIRTIO=y
    CONFIG_CROSS_COMPILE="aarch64-linux-gnu-"
```
```
    $ ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- make -j40
```

If the build was successful, you should have a `arch/arm64/boot/Image` file.

## Obtain qemu for ARM64

Obtain the QEMU source from git or from the latest source release.

    $ ./configure
    $ make -j40

If the build was successful, you should have a `aarch64-softmmu/qemu-system-aarch64` binary.

## Boot up manually

You should be able to start up the kernel as follows.

    $ /path/to/aarch64-softmmu/qemu-system-aarch64 \
      -machine virt \
      -cpu cortex-a57 \
      -nographic -smp 1 \
      -hda /path/to/rootfs.ext3 \
      -kernel /path/to/arch/arm64/boot/Image \
      -append "console=ttyAMA0 root=/dev/vda oops=panic panic_on_warn=1 panic=-1 ftrace_dump_on_oops=orig_cpu debug earlyprintk=serial slub_debug=UZ" \
      -m 2048 \
      -net user,hostfwd=tcp::10023-:22 -net nic

At this point, you should be able to see a login prompt.

## Set up the QEMU disk

Now that we have a shell, let us add a few lines to existing init scripts so that they are executed each time Syzkaller brings up the VM.

At the top of /etc/init.d/S50sshd add the following lines:

    ifconfig eth0 up
    dhcpcd
    mount -t debugfs none /sys/kernel/debug
    chmod 777 /sys/kernel/debug/kcov

Comment out the line

    /usr/bin/ssh-keygen -A

Next we set up ssh. Create an ssh keypair locally and copy the public key to `/authorized_keys` in `/`. Ensure that you do not set a passphrase when creating this key.

Open `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` and modify the following lines as shown below.

    PermitRootLogin yes
    PubkeyAuthentication yes
    AuthorizedKeysFile      /authorized_keys
    PasswordAuthentication yes

Reboot the machine, and ensure that you can ssh from host to guest as.

    $ ssh -i /path/to/id_rsa root@localhost -p 10023

## Build syzkaller

Build syzkaller as described [here](/docs/linux/setup.md#go-and-syzkaller), with `arm64` target:

```
CC=gcc-linaro-6.3.1-2017.05-x86_64_aarch64-linux-gnu/bin/aarch64-linux-gnu-g++
make TARGETARCH=arm64
```


## Modify your config file and start off syzkaller

A sample config file that exercises the required options are shown below. Modify according to your needs.

```
{
    "name": "QEMU-aarch64",
    "target": "linux/arm64",
    "http": ":56700",
    "workdir": "/path/to/a/dir/to/store/syzkaller/corpus",
    "kernel_obj": "/path/to/linux/build/dir",
    "syzkaller": "/path/to/syzkaller/arm64/",
    "image": "/path/to/rootfs.ext3",
    "sshkey": "/path/to/id_rsa",
    "procs": 8,
    "type": "qemu",
    "vm": {
        "count": 1,
        "qemu": "/path/to/qemu-system-aarch64",
        "cmdline": "console=ttyAMA0 root=/dev/vda",
        "kernel": "/path/to/Image",
        "cpu": 2,
        "mem": 2048
    }
}
```

At this point, you should be able to visit `localhost:56700` and view the results of the fuzzing.

If you get issues after `syz-manager` starts, consider running it with the `-debug` flag.
