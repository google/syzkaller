# How to install syzkaller

Generic setup instructions are outlined [here](setup_generic.md).
Instructions for a particular VM or kernel arch can be found on these pages:

- [Setup: Ubuntu host, QEMU vm, x86-64 kernel](setup_ubuntu-host_qemu-vm_x86-64-kernel.md)
- [Setup: Ubuntu host, Odroid C2 board, arm64 kernel](setup_ubuntu-host_odroid-c2-board_arm64-kernel.md)
- [Setup: Linux host, QEMU vm, arm64 kernel](setup_linux-host_qemu-vm_arm64-kernel.md)
- [Setup: Linux host, Android device, arm64 kernel](setup_linux-host_android-device_arm64-kernel.md)

After following these instructions you should be able to run `syz-manager`, see it executing programs and be able to access statistics exposed at `http://127.0.0.1:56741`:

```
$ ./bin/syz-manager -config=my.cfg
