# Fuchsia support

For information about checking out and building Fuchsia see [Get started with
Fuchsia](https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/get-started) and [Download the Fuchsia
source code](https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/get-started/get_fuchsia_source).

## Caveat

Please note that Fuchsia support is currently incomplete, and may break at any
time due to changes in Fuchsia and/or Syzkaller.

Some known issues include:

* System call definitions require manual updates.
* Crash parsing does not work reliably.
* Coverage feedback is not supported.

## Prerequisites

To run Syzkaller with a Fuchsia target, you will need a checkout of the Fuchsia
source repository.

The rest of this document will use the environment variable `SOURCEDIR` to
identify the path to your Fuchsia checkout (e.g. `/home/you/fuchsia`). The
commands below assume you have set `SOURCEDIR`, like so:

```bash
export SOURCEDIR=/home/you/fuchsia
```

## Quick and easy version

The shell script [setup.sh](setup.sh) automates the building and running
`syz-manager` steps described below. Give it a try, and see if it works for you.
For usage help, invoke it with no arguments.

## Building Fuchsia

To build Fuchsia for x64, run:

```bash
fx --dir "out/x64" set core.x64 \
  --with-base "//bundles/tools" \
  --with-base "//src/testing/fuzzing/syzkaller" \
  --args=syzkaller_dir='"/full/path/to/syzkaller"' \
  --variant=kasan
fx build
```

Alternatively, for arm64, run:

```bash
fx --dir "out/arm64" set core.arm64 \
  --with-base "//bundles/tools" \
  --with-base "//src/testing/fuzzing/syzkaller" \
  --args=syzkaller_dir='"/full/path/to/syzkaller"' \
  --variant=kasan
fx clean-build
```

## Building binaries for Fuchsia

To build all the binaries required for running Syzkaller in Fuchsia, run this
from inside your Syzkaller checkout (assuming you built Fuchsia for x64):

```bash
make TARGETOS=fuchsia TARGETARCH=amd64 SOURCEDIR=${SOURCEDIR}
```

## Running syz-manager

Running syz-manager requires you to have built Fuchsia previously, and added the
ssh keys to the fuchsia.zbi image:

```bash
${SOURCEDIR}/out/x64/host_x64/zbi -o ${SOURCEDIR}/out/x64/fuchsia-ssh.zbi \
  ${SOURCEDIR}/out/x64/fuchsia.zbi \
  --entry "data/ssh/authorized_keys=${SOURCEDIR}/.ssh/authorized_keys"
```

You will also need to extend the `fvm` image:

```bash
cp "${SOURCEDIR}/out/x64/obj/build/images/fuchsia/fuchsia/fvm.blk" "${SOURCEDIR}/out/x64/obj/build/images/fuchsia/fuchsia/fvm-extended.blk"
${SOURCEDIR}/out/x64/host_x64/fvm "${SOURCEDIR}/out/x64/obj/build/images/fuchsia/fuchsia/fvm-extended.blk" extend --length 3G
```

Note: This needs to be repeated after each `fx build`.

Create a `syz-manager` configuration file, using this as a starting point:

```json
{
  "name": "fuchsia",
  "target": "fuchsia/amd64",
  "http": ":12345",
  "workdir": "/workdir.fuchsia",
  "kernel_obj": "/fuchsia/out/syz/kernel_x64-kasan/obj/zircon/kernel",
  "syzkaller": "/syzkaller",
  "image": "/fuchsia/out/x64/obj/build/images/fuchsia/fuchsia/fvm-extended.blk",
  "sshkey": "/fuchsia/.ssh/pkey",
  "reproduce": false,
  "cover": false,
  "procs": 8,
  "type": "qemu",
  "vm": {
    "count": 10,
    "cpu": 4,
    "mem": 2048,
    "kernel": "/fuchsia/out/x64/multiboot.bin",
    "initrd": "/fuchsia/out/x64/fuchsia-ssh.zbi"
  }
}
```

Run `syz-manager` with that config:

```bash
bin/syz-manager -config manager.cfg
```

Note: You may need to modify your `PATH` so that qemu can be found, e.g.

```bash
export `PATH="$SOURCEDIR/prebuilt/third_party/qemu/linux-x64/bin:$PATH"`
```

## Update syscall and FIDL definitions

Syscall descriptions live in the `sys/fuchsia` folder. To update a syscall, you
need to modify the `.txt` file that contains it, make sure your new definition
matches the one in Zircon's
[syscalls.abigen](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/fuchsia/+/master/zircon/system/public/zircon/syscalls.abigen)
file. **If the syscall was used in `executor/common_fuchsia.h`, you need to
update the usages there as well.** FIDL definitions do not need manual updating
because they are extracted automatically when you run `make extract`, but they
require Fuchsia to be rebuilt for each architecture (see [Building
Fuchsia](#building-fuchsia) above).

Once you updated the syscall definitions, everything can be regenerated by
running (in your Syzkaller checkout):

```bash
make extract TARGETOS=fuchsia SOURCEDIR=${SOURCEDIR}
make generate
```

**Caveat:** This command does not currently work.

## How to generate syscall definitions from FIDL

TODO: This section is out of date.

Syscall descriptions for FIDL are automatically generated as part of `make
extract` as described above.

However, if you wish to manually generate syscall descriptions for a given
`.fidl` file, do the following.

FIDL files should first be compiled into FIDL intermediate representation (JSON)
files using `fidlc`:

```bash
${SOURCEDIR}/out/x64/host_x64/fidlc --json /tmp/io.json --files ${SOURCEDIR}/zircon/system/fidl/fuchsia-io/io.fidl
```

Then run the FIDL compiler backend `fidlgen` with the syzkaller generator, which
compiles a FIDL IR file into a syscall description file:

```bash
${SOURCEDIR}/out/x64/host_x64/fidlgen -generators syzkaller -json /tmp/io.json -output-base fidl_io -include-base fidl_io
```

## Running syz-ci locally

To run `syz-ci` locally for Fuchsia, you need:

- bootstrapped Fuchsia checkout (in `/bootstrap/fuchsia` dir in the example below)
- bootstrap `syz-ci` binary (in the current dir, build with `make ci`)
- `syz-ci` config similar to the one below (in `ci.cfg` file in the current dir)

```json
{
	"name": "testci",
	"http": ":50000",
	"manager_port_start": 50001,
	"syzkaller_repo": "https://github.com/google/syzkaller.git",
	"managers": [
		{
			"name": "fuchsia",
			"repo": "https://fuchsia.googlesource.com",
			"manager_config": {
				"target": "fuchsia/amd64",
				"type": "qemu",
				"cover": false,
				"procs": 8,
				"vm": {
					"count": 4,
					"cpu": 4,
					"mem": 1024
				}
			}
		}
	]
}
```

Run `syz-ci` as:

```bash
SOURCEDIR=/bootstrap/fuchsia ./syz-ci -config ci.cfg
```

## Troubleshooting

While running the `make extract` step, it's possible that the FIDL definitions
are not up to date. It could happen that they have been removed or renamed.

If this is the case, you would see an error mentioning that the fidl.json file
could not be found:

```bash
go generate ./sys/fuchsia
cannot find /path-to-fuchsia/out/x64/fidling/gen/zircon/public/fidl/zircon-ethernet/zircon-ethernet.fidl.json
exit status 1
```

You can search for the string in [the Fuchsia code search
interface](https://cs.opensource.google/fuchsia/fuchsia/+/main:) or in [the
Gerrit code-review tool](https://fuchsia-review.googlesource.com/) to see what
happened to it. If the FIDL interface was renamed or removed, you should update
`sys/fuchsia/fidlgen/main.go` to reflect this change, and remove the stale
autogenerated files.
